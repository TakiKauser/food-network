                <p>Panera Bread’s delightful seasonal chowder features sweet corn kernels that are balanced with a creamy base and spicy accents. Its popularity grows every year, and fans can’t wait to indulge in one of the few warm soups that you’d actually want to eat on a summer day. The vegetarian-friendly chowder pairs perfectly with a vibrant green salad or a thick slice of crusty bread. It is loaded with a handful of vegetables to give you a wonderfully chunky bite with each spoonful.</p>

                <h2 class="center-item">Bourbon-Peach Barbecue Sauce</h2>
                <p>Smoked paprika comes from a centuries-old tradition in which chile peppers are slowly dried over low-burning fires of Spanish oak and then ground into powder. In the slow cooker, this earthy, aromatic spice adds outdoor smoked barbecue flavor. The smoked paprika adds a subtle smokiness that enhances the kick from the jalapeño and cayenne peppers. Finish the soup with freshly chopped cilantro and a squeeze of fresh lime juice for brightness. </p>

                <h2 class="center-item">Wrapped Baby Back Ribs</h2>
                <p>You don’t have to be an expert smoker to make tender, expertly seasoned smoked pork chops. Our recipe works for beginners and pros. The seasoning mixture and overnight sitting will make the best crust possible, which will make the smoking process go smoothly. Have your butcher cut your chops to the size needed for this recipe—weight and thickness are super important here. Serve with red wine, roasted veggies, salad, and cold beer.</p>
